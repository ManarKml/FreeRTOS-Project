# FreeRTOS-Project
The project is implemented using FreeRTOS on the target emulation board provided via Eclipse CDT Embedded.

The system consists of 3 sender tasks and one receiver. Sender 3 has the highest priority while the other two sender tasks are the same priority. Each sender task has a timer of random period generated by uniform distribution function, while the period of the receiver task is fixed to 100msec. The uniform distribution function is controlled by 6 upper and lower bounds. Each sender task sends a message to the queue containing “Time is XYZ”, from then a counter is incremented for the number of sent messages. If a sender attempts to send while the queue is full, the message is counted as a blocked message. The receiver can receive a maximum of 1000 messages.
